# Restful chinook

This module's project is a two-week group project. Anything goes! The most important thing to keep in mind for this module's project is scoping, it's better to build something small that works than something big that doesn't.
Here's a [starter repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/restful-chinook) you can use, but you don't have to.
A good reference could be [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i3Z3y46KsM) without all the charts and visualizations.
